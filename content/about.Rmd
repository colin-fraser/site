My name is Colin. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Facebook in Seattle, Washington. I work on the Community Integrity team, primarily on the problem of hate speech. I do a whole lot of my work with R, but I also like to use Python for some things. I do a little bit of teaching on the side. I’ll write about all kinds of different things here.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at `colin dot r dot fraser at g mail dot com`, [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/colin_fraser), or, I don’t know, it’s pretty easy to get in touch with people on the internet these days.

# About this Website
This website was created with [Blogdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html), following the generously detailed instructions from the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). This allows me to write posts using Rmarkdown, which lets me put code right into posts that renders right in the posts.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=price, x=carat, color=cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle('See? I made this plot just for the About page')
```
