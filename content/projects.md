### `colinlib`
I started keeping functions that I find myself use frequently in their own package. Creatively, I called this [`colinlib`](https://github.com/colin-fraser/colinlib).

### Radlibrary
[Radlibrary](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Radlibrary) is an R package for querying the Facebook Ad library API. This is useful for researchers who want data on political ads.
  
### Queries
[Queries](https://github.com/colin-fraser/queries) is a package that I use for templating SQL queries.
