My name is Colin. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Meta. I work on the team that builds systems that help Facebook and Instagram react to global civic crises.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at <code>colin dot r dot fraser at g mail dot com</code>, <a href="https://twitter.com/colin_fraser">tweet at me</a>, or, I don’t know, it’s pretty easy to get in touch with people on the internet these days.</p>

<h1>About this Website</h1>
<p>This website was created with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html">Blogdown</a>, following the generously detailed instructions from the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown book</a>. This allows me to write posts using Rmarkdown, which lets me put code right into posts that renders right in the posts.</p>
