<p>My main job at Facebook is working on finding and getting rid of hate speech on the platform, but Radlibrary is a side project that I maintain. Radlibrary is an R package for querying the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/">Facebook Ad Library API</a>, and transforming the results into tidy dataframes suitable for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/facebookreasearch/Radlibrary">Github</a>, and it’s easy to install using <code>devtools</code> with <code>devtools::install_github(&quot;facebookresearch/Radlibrary&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>The full documentation is <a href="http://facebookresearch.github.io/Radlibrary/">here</a>, which includes a guide to obtaining the necessary access credentials.</p>
<p>If you’re using the package, I’d love to hear from you! You can tweet at me, or feel free to open an issue on Github.</p>
