My main job at Facebook is working with hate speech, but Radlibrary is a side project that I maintain. Radlibrary is an R package for querying the [Facebook Ad Library API](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/), and transforming the results into tidy dataframes suitable for statistical analysis.

You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/facebookreasearch/Radlibrary), and it's easy to install using `devtools` with `devtools::install_github("facebookresearch/Radlibrary")`. 

The full documentation is [here](http://facebookresearch.github.io/Radlibrary/), which includes a guide to obtaining the necessary access credentials.

If you're using the package, I'd love to hear from you! You can tweet at me, or feel free to open an issue on Github.
