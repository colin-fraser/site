<p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest">has a nice COVID-19 dashboard</a> that shows the growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world, including for US states, but I haven’t seen a great version of these charts for Canadian provinces. I borrowed some of the methodology from that page to come up with some Canada-centric charts. Hopefully these will be helpful for some people. The data comes from the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins COVID-19 resource center</a>, which they’ve shared publicly in <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">this Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>I can’t guarantee the accuracy of the information here, but it should be consistent with what you can find on the Johns Hopkins dashboard. Please send me a message on Twitter if you find anything that seems suspicious.</p>
<div id="confirmed-cases" class="section level2">
<h2>Confirmed Cases</h2>
<div id="confirmed-cases-since-the-10th-case" class="section level3">
<h3>Confirmed Cases Since The 10th Case</h3>
<p>This chart shows the number of confirmed cases in each province, with the number of days since the 10th case on the x-axis. I’ve included New York State and Washington State for comparison, since those are two of the major US outbreaks. The dashed lines indicate how this chart would look if doubling the number of cases took 2, 3, or 4 days.</p>

<p>This shows the number of deaths on each date (min 3 deaths). Note, I am not sure why Quebec dips for a few days, but this is consistent with the data provided by the JHU dashboard.</p>
