      <description>I’ve written a lot in other places—mostly Medium, but I think in 2020 we’re doing our own websites. Blogdown has gotten so good that it feels like a big waste of time to write posts in RMarkdown and translate them over to Medium like I’ve been doing. So this is where I’m going to write my stuff now. I’ll probably spend some time migrating some of the existing posts over to this site too.</description>

      <description>My main job at Facebook is working with hate speech, but Radlibrary is a side project that I maintain. Radlibrary is an R package for querying the Facebook Ad Library API, and transforming the results into tidy dataframes suitable for statistical analysis.
You can find the project on Github, and it’s easy to install using devtools with devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;facebookresearch/Radlibrary&amp;quot;).
The full documentation is here, which includes a guide to obtaining the necessary access credentials.</description>

      <description>My name is Colin. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Facebook in Seattle, Washington. I work on the Community Integrity team, primarily on the problem of hate speech. I do a whole lot of my work with R, but I also like to use Python for some things. I do a little bit of teaching on the side. I’ll write about all kinds of different things here.</description>
